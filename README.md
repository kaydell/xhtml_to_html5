xhtml_to_html5
=================

This project is an exercise for students to convert an earlier
version of HTML to HTML5.  The earlier version of HTML is XHTML 1.0 
Transitional.

There may still be a use for XHTML 1.0 Transitional but assume for
this exercise that your client want to update to HTML5.
