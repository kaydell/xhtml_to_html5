Kaydell's Original Butterflies XHTML Exercise

This is an exercise that I did in school, for XHTML 1.0 Transitional
because my textbooks said at that time (written a couple of years ago)
that HTML5 might be too new for some browsers.

It depends upon the site, but I think that now my focus should be HTML5.
So, we're going to update this exercise to HTML5.
